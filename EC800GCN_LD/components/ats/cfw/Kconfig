        From specification, syntax of the command "AT+IPR=115200&W" is
        incorrect. However, it is common used. This option is to support
        this non-standard syntax.

        To support this, the syntax parser of AT command line isn't changed.
        Just +IPR command handler will process 115200&W parameter.

        It is recommended to enable this option.
